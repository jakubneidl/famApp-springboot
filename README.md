# famApp-springboot
SpringBoot App for Arduino FarmBot.
This is my solution to one of my learing projects.

Main logic of the farm, when to water, how much to water and what to water is done on the backend server. The server comunicates bak and forwards with Arduino using JSON messages.

Measured data from the sensors are saved to the database and can be and are presented by the vue.js app.

Arduino, ESP and vuejs code are stored in the other farmApp repositories.
